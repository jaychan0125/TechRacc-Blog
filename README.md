## Description 
This weeks challenge was to make a tech blog from scratch! All of it, omg it took me so long to get it to how I wanted it working. The requirements were so long. But I am finally happy with the results! This blog includes user signup and login validation, using databases. We shouldn't store passwords in databases in the real world, but this was to demonstrate bcrypt encryption. We also utilized different CRUD operations and pathways as well as handlebars to help generate the pages. Sequelize was also used to help make databases to store info such as Users, Posts, Comments, etc. Feel free to have a look around!
